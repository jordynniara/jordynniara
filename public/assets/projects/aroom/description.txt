ARoom
ARoom transforms the furniture shopping experience by utilizing augmented reality to allow users to preview items in their space. The app includes a style quiz to help users discover their preferred interior decorating style and enables them to add items to a wish list and create virtual rooms. Users can purchase items from multiple stores in a single transaction, streamlining the shopping process. On the desktop app, users can generate QR codes to view items in AR on their mobile devices. ARoom offers a personalized, interactive, and efficient approach to furniture shopping.
