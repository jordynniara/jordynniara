      <p>
        The Creativity Project is an exploration of the intersection between technology and creativity. It aims to understand how can technology,
        especially AI, enhance our creativity, but also how can it usurp it. I'm fascinated by the ethical implications of AI and its impact on society.
        Where do we draw the line on what we will and won't design to ensure humans are empowered, not erased nor exploited. This project is currently
        being developed and researched but will be an interactive experience for site visitors to take part in.

        Once finished it will be featured here.
