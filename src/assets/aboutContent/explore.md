Originally from the Chicagoland Area, I am based in Atlanta, Georgia where I live with my husband and our dog Jada. When I'm not coding you can find me engaging in one of my many hobbies. I bake. I hike. I draw (albeit poorly). I garden. I play video games. I teach my dog new tricks. I box and if I'm feeling kicky I Muay Thai. As a self-proclaimed jack of all trades, I'm always curious and always exploring, taking lessons from everything around me.
