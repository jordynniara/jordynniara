My commitment to human-centered design is inseparable from my commitment to community. While earning my bachelor’s in Computer Science, I learned that creativity extends far beyond traditional art—everything can be art. Later, in my master’s program in Human–Computer Interaction, I came to understand that everything is designed, and every design has impact. That realization made design feel like power, and it pushed me to ask harder questions: Where do we draw the line? When does a design help, and when does it harm? Does it empower, exploit, or even erase? These questions guide my work, but they also guide how I show up in the world. Through mentoring with Black Girls Code, leading Hour of Code sessions, supporting hackathons, organizing volunteer efforts at work, and participating in community clean‑ups and food distribution projects, I try to create the kind of impact that reflects the values I bring into my professional life. Whether I’m designing technology or serving my community, I’m driven by the same belief: impact matters, and we are responsible for the futures we help shape.
