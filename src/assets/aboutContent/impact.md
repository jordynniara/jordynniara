While getting my bachelors in Computer Science I learned creativity goes beyond art, or rather everything can be art. While getting my masters in Human Computer Interaction I learned everything is designed and has impact, thus design is power. I decided then that I'd be a Human Centered Designer which to me means asking the question "where do we draw the line?" At what point is this design hurting instead of helping humanity? Is it empowering or exploiting or worse, erasing? These are the questions that underscore my work and drive my curiosity.
