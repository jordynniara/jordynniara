I've spent most of my professional career at Microsoft where I've had the benefit of learning how to build tools and services for
for everyone from small teams of developers to thousands of customers across the globe. My experience spans various domains, including cloud computing, developer tools, and user experience design. Throughout my career my passion has always lied in creating seamless and intuitive user experiences. Even when placed in charge of developing and supporting the backend of Microsoft' cloud services, I always kept the end user in mind and find ways to tailor my work to meet their needs.
