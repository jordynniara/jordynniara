## Experience
### **Senior Software Engineer | Microsoft**
*August 2019 - Present | Various*

#### AI/UX Prototyping Research

- Designed and developed a RAG‑based agent proof of concept that surfaces historical engineering knowledge to reduce on‑call investigation time to secure stakeholder alignment; conducted user interviews and surveys to validate workflows and pain points.
- Partnered with international teams to define plans to translate research insights into interaction flows, robust prompt engineering, and an expanded beta version to be used by engineers.

#### Frontend Engineering & UX for Azure VM Scale Sets

- Designed and shipped customer‑facing UX improvements that increased redeployment success confidence by working with partner engineers and PMs to provide clearer retry guidance and actionable error insights to end users.
- Built a secure “passwordless” VM/VMSS creation experience, reducing credential‑related vulnerabilities and improving onboarding usability for enterprise customers while collaborating with several other team lead engineers to ensure alignment across multiple services.
#### Design Systems & Internal Tools
- Led the redesign and migration of an internal open-source-software  tracking tool from Angular to React, improving usability, performance, and maintainability.
- Designed and built a React‑based dashboard application (later ported to Electron) used across engineering teams for monitoring and reporting.
#### Accessibility & UI Engineering for WinDbg
- Led the accessibility modernization of WinDbg, improving WCAG compliance and significantly increasing Accessibility Insights scores.
- Implemented new UI components, interaction patterns, and visual refinements across the application.
#### Design & UX Leadership
- Designed the official logo for the Atlanta Black at Microsoft (BAM) chapter and consulted on UX improvements for the internal BAM mobile app, enhancing usability and accessibility.
#### General Leadership and Collaboration
- Facilitated in-team retrospectives with fellow engineers that celebrate achievements and identify points of friction within the team to ensure consistent growth in cohesion, collaboration and communication. I shared findings with team leaders in an anonymous newsletter to bolster transparency and trust among the team.
