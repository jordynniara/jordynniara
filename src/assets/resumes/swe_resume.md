## Professional Experience

### **Senior Software Engineer | Microsoft**
*August 2019 - Present | Atlanta, GA*

#### Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets - Cloud, Distributed Systems & Backend Engineering

- Designed, developed, and maintained core VMSS features in a large-scale distributed system, collaborating with global engineering teams for key features including:
  - A deployment retry-guidance feature that increased customer deployment success rates and reduced friction during failure scenarios.
  - A passwordless VM/VMSS provisioning flow that strengthens security by reducing risk of credential-interception.
- Served as the directly responsible individual (DRI) during on-call rotations, leading incident response, mitigating high-volume customer-impacting issues, and driving root-cause analysis to resolution.
- Developed a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agent proof-of-concept leveraging historical engineering journals to accelerate livesite investigations and reduce mitigation time.
- Led global production service code releases, ensuring successful rollout of new features, monitoring deployment health, resolving failures in real time, and updating release documentation to improve operational reliability.
- Improved service quality by identifying, diagnosing, and resolving production bugs across VMSS components.
- Contributed to architecture reviews, design discussions, and internal one-pager evaluations to improve feature feasibility, reliability, and long-term maintainability.
- Led several technical brownbag sessions to share knowledge on new features, cloud technologies, and industry trends.

#### Frontend Engineering & App Development

- Built and maintained a React-based dashboard hosted on Azure; later migrated it to a cross-platform Electron desktop application.
- Led UI/UX and front-end development for WinDbg, including accessibility improvements aligned with WCAG standards and implementation of new UI features.
- Resolved front-end defects and improved performance, usability, and accessibility across multiple internal tools.

#### Accessibility & UX

- Conducted user research with on-call engineers to inform the design of the RAG agent and improve engineering workflows.
- Consulted on UX improvements for the internal BAM mobile application, enhancing usability and accessibility.

#### Branding & Internal Contributions

- Organized volunteer initiatives for employees across the organization to support and engage with the local community.
- Coordinated ERG programming for Black women engineers, creating a safe and empowering space for connection and professional development.
- Mentored local youth and early-in-career employees, supporting underrepresented communities' exposure to technology through panels, hackathon judging, and Hour of Code sessions.
- Designed the official logo for the Atlanta chapter of Black at Microsoft (BAM), used across all ERG communications.
